# Acme Events 
*Acme Events* is a portfolio site with a sense of humour. Ostensibly, the company organises and sells tickets to events at which would-be consumers can view the latest and greatest in the way of anvils.

An anvil is a blacksmithing tool more familiar to many as the heavy object often dropped on cartoon characters and made famous in this regard by Warner Brothers' Looney Tunes animations. Like almost all products within these Warner Bros. productions, anvils often bore a manufacturer's mark crediting them to ["Acme Corp."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation). The ficticious corporation has since become a standin or placeholder wherever a fake company is needed and is even used in some jurisdictions Law Schools Admissions Tests as the plaintiff or defendent in example cases.

For the purely fictional business represented by this portfolio project, therefore, the company in question is "Acme Events". As the products showcased at the events do not matter and the purpose of the site is to demonstrate an online booking system for an events company, anvils were chosen as a humorous stand-in.

## Problem Statement  
Events companies advertising online face a unique version of a common problem; they wish to capture the consumer's full attention at the point of peak interest and prompt the user to take action, however, the event itself may be at a distant point in the future. The ability to sell tickets or take bookings in advance therefore represents a tremendous advantage to their business.

Third-party platforms to meet this need are in no shortage; however, a percentage of ticket sales is usually lost to platform fees, and the business loses control over how their material is represented when it's rendered on another site. In addition, consumer interest may be lost as the customer clicks through to the platform and is often taken away from the event company's own website. In addition, such platforms depend on their revenue from maximising tickets sales across all events, and may therefore advertise related and even competing events to the customer. In short, the interests of the company and the platform are not entirely aligned.

Ideally therefore, an event company would have its own native booking system with integrated payment through a secure, reputable payment processing service. Such a system would not take the consumer-user away from the site and would allow them to make multiple bookings, even across multiple events, without leaving the site.

While many future features may yet be implemented, Acme Events demonstrates this solution in practice.
